# Kubernetes Learning Repository

This repository contains YAML files and documentation of the steps and commands I performed during my learning of Kubernetes.

## Introduction

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a platform-agnostic way to deploy and manage applications in a containerized environment. Kubernetes abstracts away the underlying infrastructure and provides a consistent API to manage containers across multiple environments.

This repository is intended to document my kubernetes-learning through the course of the Kodekloud CKA [KodeKloud CKA](https://kodekloud.com/courses/certified-kubernetes-administrator-cka/) course through creating a Kubernetes cluster on Azure from scratch using Kubeadm.

## Contents

The repository contains the following:

- YAML files: These are configuration files for deploying Kubernetes resources such as pods, services, deployments, and more.
- Documentation: This includes guides and yaml files on how to deploy and manage Kubernetes resources using the command line interface (CLI).
